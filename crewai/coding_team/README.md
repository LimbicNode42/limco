# Limco - Autonomous Software Development Company

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Author**: LimbicNode42  

An AI-powered autonomous software development company built with CrewAI that can take high-level business goals and autonomously plan, analyze, and provide comprehensive project proposals.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- API Keys for AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)
- Optional: Serper API key for web search

### Installation
```bash
cd limco
pip install -e .
```

### Setup Environment
Create a `.env` file:
```bash
# Required: Choose one AI provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here  
# OR
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Optional: Web search for market research
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
```

### First Run
```bash
# Test the system (uses faster rate limiting)
python -m limco.main test

# Test with conservative rate limiting (safer)
python -m limco.main test-safe

# Run with example project (conservative rate limiting)
python -m limco.main run

# Run with aggressive rate limiting (faster but may hit limits)
python -m limco.main run-fast

# Run with your own goal
python -m limco.main run "Your project description here..."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Rate Limiting & API Management

Limco includes intelligent rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion and handle rate limits gracefully.

### Rate Limiting Modes

**Conservative Mode (Default - Recommended)**
- 5 second delays between operations
- Up to 8 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Maximum 5 minute retry delays
- Best for: Standard API accounts, production use

**Aggressive Mode (For Premium Users)**
- 3 second delays between operations  
- Up to 6 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Maximum 2 minute retry delays
- Best for: Premium API accounts, testing

### Commands with Rate Limiting

```bash
# Conservative (safer, slower)
python -m limco.main run               # Default mode
python -m limco.main test-safe         # Conservative testing

# Aggressive (faster, may hit limits)  
python -m limco.main run-fast          # Aggressive mode
python -m limco.main test              # Aggressive testing
```

### Handling Rate Limits

If you encounter rate limit errors:
1. **Wait and retry** - Rate limits usually reset after a few minutes
2. **Use conservative mode** - `python -m limco.main run` (default)
3. **Check API quotas** - Ensure you have sufficient API credits
4. **Customize settings** - Edit `rate_limiting.conf` for your needs
