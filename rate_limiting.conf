# Limco Rate Limiting Configuration
#
# Adjust these settings based on your API rate limits and preferences.
# Conservative settings are safer but slower, aggressive settings are faster but may hit limits.

# =============================================================================
# CONSERVATIVE SETTINGS (Default - Recommended for most users)
# =============================================================================
# Best for: Standard API accounts, first-time users, production usage
# Characteristics: Slower but more reliable, handles rate limits gracefully

[conservative]
base_delay = 3.0          # Seconds between API calls
max_delay = 180.0         # Maximum retry delay (3 minutes)
max_retries = 6           # Number of retry attempts
backoff_factor = 2.0      # Exponential backoff multiplier

# =============================================================================  
# AGGRESSIVE SETTINGS (For users with higher API limits)
# =============================================================================
# Best for: Premium API accounts, testing, users with high rate limits
# Characteristics: Faster execution but may hit rate limits more frequently

[aggressive] 
base_delay = 1.5          # Seconds between API calls
max_delay = 60.0          # Maximum retry delay (1 minute) 
max_retries = 4           # Number of retry attempts
backoff_factor = 2.0      # Exponential backoff multiplier

# =============================================================================
# CUSTOM SETTINGS (Advanced users)
# =============================================================================
# You can create your own settings profile here
# Copy one of the above sections and modify the values

[custom]
base_delay = 2.0          # Your custom base delay
max_delay = 120.0         # Your custom max delay
max_retries = 5           # Your custom retry count
backoff_factor = 2.0      # Your custom backoff factor

# =============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# To use custom settings, modify src/limco/main.py and change:
#   create_rate_limited_crew(crew, aggressive_mode=False)
# to:
#   create_rate_limited_crew(crew, rate_config=your_custom_config)
#
# Rate limiting helps prevent:
# - API rate limit errors (429 Too Many Requests)
# - Quota exhaustion
# - Service degradation
# - Account suspension
#
# Increase delays if you frequently encounter:
# - Rate limit errors
# - Connection timeouts
# - "Too many requests" messages
#
# Decrease delays if you have:
# - Premium API accounts
# - Higher rate limits
# - Need faster execution
