# Rate Limiting Configuration Updates

## 🎯 Issue Addressed

Based on testing feedback that showed only 2/2 retries before failure, indicating insufficient retry attempts and delays for handling API rate limits effectively.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Increased Conservative Mode Settings (Default)
**Before**:
- Base delay: 3.0 seconds
- Max delay: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- Max retries: 6 attempts

**After**:
- Base delay: **5.0 seconds** (+67% increase)
- Max delay: **300 seconds (5 minutes)** (+67% increase)  
- Max retries: **8 attempts** (+33% increase)

### 2. Improved Aggressive Mode Settings
**Before**:
- Base delay: 1.5 seconds
- Max delay: 60 seconds (1 minute)
- Max retries: 4 attempts

**After**:
- Base delay: **3.0 seconds** (+100% increase)
- Max delay: **120 seconds (2 minutes)** (+100% increase)
- Max retries: **6 attempts** (+50% increase)

### 3. Enhanced Crew-Level Retry Logic
**Before**:
- 3 crew execution attempts
- 30s, 60s retry delays

**After**:
- **5 crew execution attempts** (+67% increase)
- **60s, 120s, 180s, 240s** retry delays (longer waits)

### 4. Updated Documentation
- `rate_limiting.conf` with new settings and retry explanation
- `README.md` with updated timing information
- Help command with current delay/retry counts
- Added explanation of two-level retry system

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Conservative Mode (Default)
- **Total potential delay per API call**: Up to 5 minutes with 8 retries
- **Crew-level retries**: Up to 15 minutes total wait time (5 attempts)
- **Use case**: Standard API accounts, production usage

### Aggressive Mode  
- **Total potential delay per API call**: Up to 2 minutes with 6 retries
- **Crew-level retries**: Up to 15 minutes total wait time (5 attempts)
- **Use case**: Premium API accounts, higher rate limits

## 🛡️ Two-Level Retry System

1. **API Call Level**: Individual API failures get exponential backoff retries
2. **Crew Level**: Complete crew failures get progressive delay retries

This ensures maximum resilience against both temporary API issues and sustained rate limiting.

## 🚀 Commands Updated

All commands now use the enhanced retry logic:
```bash
# Conservative (5s delays, 8 retries per API call, 5 crew retries)
python -m limco.main run

# Aggressive (3s delays, 6 retries per API call, 5 crew retries)  
python -m limco.main run-fast

# Testing with appropriate retry settings
python -m limco.main test       # Aggressive
python -m limco.main test-safe  # Conservative
```

The system should now be much more resilient to API rate limits and provide better recovery from the rate limit scenarios you encountered.
