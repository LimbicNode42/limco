# LangGraph Projects

This directory contains projects built using the LangGraph framework for workflow-based agentic solutions.

## About LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It's designed to create cyclical flows and complex reasoning patterns with agents.

## Key Features

- **State Management**: Built-in state persistence and management
- **Workflow Definition**: Graph-based workflow definition
- **Conditional Logic**: Support for conditional branches and loops
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Built-in support for human intervention
- **Streaming**: Real-time streaming of intermediate results

## Coming Soon

We'll be adding LangGraph-based projects that showcase:
- Complex multi-step reasoning workflows
- State-dependent agent interactions
- Conditional workflow execution
- Human-in-the-loop decision making
